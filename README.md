# What is this?
Simple Safe Performant Minimalistic SaveFile API for Unity

# How it works
* Packer packs / unpacks data to/from a binary OR JSON file
* Saved data is hashed and hash info added to file
* When loading file its possible to check whether data hash matches the one saved - to avoid edited save files (fe using any hex editor)
* SaveFile versions packed / unpacked automatically
* Smaller save file sizes
